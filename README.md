# Password_Generator
module_5_challenge_Advanced_JS

create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code.

Description

Having been given starter code for the password generator I was instructed to creat an app that would:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
